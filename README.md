If you've worked at a repair shop you quickly realize mantaining proper communication regarding a customer's equipment can be a real problem. Both between the people who work at the shop, and between the shop and the customers.

Commercial solutions, while functional, had more functionality than what I needed at the time, and also where more expensive than what I was willing to pay month after month.
This solution has been working ok, since June 30, 2018 in a multi location repair shop.

A future SaaS version with a more functionality and a free tier is currently on the works.

## Features
- **User authentication** via Firebase Auth Ui
- Multiple locations
- Customers database
- Tickets database

- Notes system inside each ticket
- Registers tickets as closed once the equipment is paid for and delivered

## Prerequisites

- Firebase Hosting

## Getting started
This will be a blog post to keep the readme more concise

## Contribute
While the code is functional as it is, there's a lot of room for improvement.
I added a [TODO](./TODO.md) with things I think may add value to the project, but obviously I may be missing more things.
I'm always open to hearing what someone may need!
