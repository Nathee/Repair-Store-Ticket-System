# Repair Store Ticket System
>Currently being worked on

A handy ticket system for Repair Shops.

If you've worked at a repair shop you quickly realize mantaining proper communication between your team regarding a customer's equipment or communication with them can be a real problem.

Commercial solutions were great, except they had more functionality than what I needed at the time, and also where more expensive than what I was willing to pay at the moment and four our (basic) needs.  
This solution has been working for over 6 months in a multi location repair shop.

A future SaaS version with a more functionality and a free tier is currently on the works, it will be released later this year.

## Contribute
While the code is functional as it is, there's a lot of room for improvement.  
I added a [TODO](./TODO.md) with things I think may add value to the project, but obviously I may be missing more things.  
I'm always open to hearing what someone may need!
